# Discord Code Stats Bot

![Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-1.0.0-blue.svg)
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-green.svg)

A Discord bot that calculates and displays code statistics for a specified directory. It uses the `code-stats` npm package to calculate the statistics and discord.js to interact with Discord.

## Installation

<<<<<<< HEAD
\`\`\`bash
npm install discord.js @hotsuop/codestats
\`\`\`
=======
```bash
npm install discord.js @hotsuop/codestats
```
Usage
Once the bot is running, you can use the !codeStats command in any text channel that the bot has access to. The bot will then calculate the code statistics for the specified directory and display them in an embedded message.

API
javascript
Copy code
getCodeStats(folderPath: string, config: Object): Promise<Object>
Returns a promise that resolves with an object containing code statistics or rejects with an error if the directory couldn't be read.

Once the bot is running, you can use the \`!codeStats\` command in any text channel that the bot has access to. The bot will then calculate the code statistics for the specified directory and display them in an embedded message.

## API

\`\`\`js
getCodeStats(folderPath: string, config: Object): Promise<Object>
\`\`\`

Returns a promise that resolves with an object containing code statistics or rejects with an error if the directory couldn't be read.

- \`folderPath\`: The path to the directory to analyze.
- \`config\`: An optional configuration object.

## Example

\`\`\`js
const getCodeStats = require('./index.js');

// Define the folder path to analyze  
const folderPath = './hold';

// Define the configuration object
const config = {
languages: ['js', 'py', 'ts', 'json'], // Add your desired languages
exclude: ['node_modules', 'build'],
depthLimit: Infinity,
};

// Call getCodeStats with the folder path and configuration
getCodeStats(folderPath, config)
.then(projectStats => {
// Display the calculated project stats
console.log('Project Statistics:');
console.log(\`Total Files: \${projectStats.totalFiles}\`);
console.log(\`Total Lines: \${projectStats.totalLines}\`);
console.log(\`Total Characters: \${projectStats.totalCharacters}\`);
console.log(\`Total Functions: \${projectStats.totalFunctions}\`);
console.log(\`Total Classes: \${projectStats.totalClasses}\`);
console.log(\`Total Comments: \${projectStats.totalComments}\`);
})
.catch(error => {
console.error(error.message);
});

## Summary
The code snippet is a JavaScript function called `getCodeStats` that takes a folder path and a configuration object as inputs. It returns a promise that resolves with an object containing code statistics or rejects with an error if the directory couldn't be read.

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- `folderPath` (string): The path to the directory to analyze.
- `config` (object): An optional configuration object.

### Flow
1. The `getCodeStats` function is called with the `folderPath` and `config` as inputs.
2. The function internally uses the `code-stats` npm package to calculate the code statistics for the specified directory.
3. If the directory can be read successfully, the promise resolves with an object containing the code statistics.
4. The code statistics are then displayed in the console, including the total number of files, lines, characters, functions, classes, and comments.
5. If there is an error reading the directory, the promise rejects with an error message, which is then logged to the console.

### Outputs
- The code snippet outputs the code statistics for the specified directory, including the total number of files, lines, characters, functions, classes, and comments.
